Whilst VR is widely known and made use of in todayâ€™s society, it is safe to say that not everyone actively participates in it. The concept of VR itself is beneficial to modern society as it provokes further discoveries and thoughts beyond the virtual 3D world, as well as encourages others to find creative ways of enhancing it. Furthermore, the world of VR allows gamers and general participants to create meaningful connections with each other through cooperative games and activities. 

This is the case in such games as Phasmophobia and Half-life Alyx that allow players to engage in a variety of actions, which in return create feelings that the players share. Another original well-known implementation of VR technology is 4D experiences. These are essentially half virtual - half real immersive visual activities which incorporate the physical special effects - such as water spraying and moving seats, as well as VR technologies (i.e. Oculus goggles and headphones). The reason why it could be seen as beneficial in the creative community society as well as amongst the general public, is due to their accessibility. They only occupy a single room and provide a safe and thrilling experience, making them perfect for development and entertainment. 

A more practical approach to VR technologies would be their implementation in engineering and architecture. Virtual reality gives professionals an opportunity to view their project in 3D, which unlocks limitless new possibilities of perfecting plans and designs. As evident, when it comes to the creative computing industry as a whole, the benefits of it are endless, as it extends from the very basics of coding to complex online networks, personal devices and other technologies. However it is important to know that creative computing, as well as computing in general, has been known for security breaches - which are constantly in need of improvement. Its accessibility also continues to be an issue, as not everyone has access to coding tools or other forms of digital tools required for creative computing. Nevertheless, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages
